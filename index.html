    <p class="introduction">The mission of the Vurb.Foundation is to research and develop applications, technologies and policy for connected public infrastructures that are highly usable and drive societal engagement.</p>

    <p>Cities are home to an increasing percentage of the world's population, while at the same time global use of network services continue to rise at an even faster pace. City governments are already working hard to provide online access to traditional civic services, like web-based information systems. As new models emerge that integrate physical provisioning such as Uber and AirBnB, cities need to rethink their role as providers of network resources.</p>

    <h3>What we do</h3>

    <p>For over 10 years, Vurb has been building prototypes of connected infrastructure, participating in policy-making on a European level, and running conferences, workshops, and seminars about the future of urban systems.  Our current research threads investigate immersive media environments in public space, collaborative systems for modelling urban plans, and turn-key backend services that cities can use to operate resource-sharing systems, whether physical like Uber and AirBnB, or cloud-based like Docker or AWS.</p>

    <p>The Vurb.Foundation develops application prototypes, develops new technologies and suggests policy to answer questions like:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Should the 'sharing economy' not be considered 'connected public infrastructure'? </li>
      <li>Can a city provide services not just like Uber and AirBnB, but also perhaps like Dropbox, Flickr, AmazonAWS, Facebook?</li>
      <li>What is the role of the library, the museum or the public school system in the life of the 21st citizen?</li>
      <li>How can residents participate in a GitHub-like process of modeling the future of their city?</li>
    </ul>
