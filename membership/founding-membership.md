# Become a founding member

We’re currently looking for founding members to help shape the Foundation for Public Code’s long term future by joining us now.

Founding members are forward-thinking public organizations with a strong principled commitment to the existence of an ecosystem of public code. You’ll be willing to take co-ownership of the Foundation and be an advocate for public code.

We are looking for organizations that can:

* help us validate our code certification and stewardship processes
* provide material support to create a public code ecosystem

We’ll open other types of membership from 2020.

## Benefits of being a founding member

As a founding member, you’ll shape the Foundation’s processes and governance.

You will:

* be one of the first to have codebases stewarded by the Foundation (reducing your future risk and maintenance costs)
* get a seat on the board of directors
* steer the Foundation’s pipeline towards projects you’d like to reuse
* gain recognition as a leader of systemic digital transformation

This is in addition to the regular benefits of Foundation membership. These include being able to:

* invoke continuous integration auditing resources on projects in development accepted by the Foundation (increasing the security of your code)
* demonstrate return on IT investments from higher levels of administration
* collectively participate in a trusted Foundation procurement strategy
* learn from and share experience with other bold, innovative public organizations and leaders in the sector

We also offer:

* access to Foundation leaders and advisors for open source strategy discussions
* entry to exclusive, invite-only public code leadership summits focused on technical, compliance, and business topics
* prominent placement of your organization’s brand on the Foundation’s social networks and web properties
* direct access to technical decision-makers of the Foundation platform
* opportunities for leadership roles in Foundation initiatives
* a blogpost announcing membership

## Founding membership requirements

To become a founding member you should have both of these:

* enthusiasm for public code at the most senior levels within your organisation
* the ability to make in-kind contributions to help us develop our processes and governance, so that they work better for your type of organisation

To become a founding member you should have some of these:

* a willingness to help the Foundation test its onboarding and code auditing processes, so we can get it right
* the ability to make a significant financial commitment relative to your type and size of organization (especially if you don’t currently have a codebase available, but are invested in creating a future for public code)
* an open source software solution that you think other public organisations will be interested in reusing
* a development team and policy experts able to work with the Foundation to refactor and document your software and policy so that they meet the Standard for Public Code

## How to join the Foundation

If your organization is curious about founding membership, then we’d love to hear from you. Please email us at <membership@publiccode.net>.
