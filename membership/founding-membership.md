# Become a founding member

We’re currently looking for founding members to help build the Foundation for Public Code’s long term future by joining us now.

Founding members are forward-thinking public organizations with a strong principled commitment to the existence of an ecosystem of public code. You’ll be willing to take co-ownership of the Foundation [in line with our draft principles] and be an advocate for public code.

We are looking for organizations that can:

* help us validate our code certification and stewardship processes
* provide material support to create a public code ecosystem

We’ll open other types of membership from 2020.

## Benefits of being a founding member

As a founding member, you’ll shape the Foundation’s processes and governance.

As a founding member, you will:

* be one of the first to have codebases stewarded by the Foundation (reducing your future risk and maintenance costs)
* get a seat on the board of directors
* steer the Foundation’s pipeline towards projects you’d like to reuse
* gain recognition as a leader of systemic digital transformation

This is in addition to the regular benefits of Foundation membership. These include being able to:

* invoke continuous integration auditing resources on projects in development accepted by the Foundation (increasing the security of your code)
* (re)use codebases from the repository, and rely on the stewarded community for support, bug fixes, and continued development (saving money on future procurement)
* demonstrate return on IT investments from higher levels of administration
* learn from and share experience with other bold, innovative public organizations
* collectively participate in a trusted Foundation procurement strategy

We also offer:

* access to Foundation leaders and advisors for open source strategy discussions
* entry to exclusive, invite-only public code leadership summits focused on technical, compliance, and business topics
* prominent placement of your organization’s brand on the Foundation’s social networks and web properties
* direct access to technical decision-makers of the Foundation platform
* opportunities for leadership roles in Foundation initiatives
* a blogpost announcing membership

## Founding membership: process validation

To become a founding member that can help us validate our code certification and stewardship processes, you should have:

* an open source software solution that you think other public organizations will be interested in reusing
* a development team and policy experts able to work with the Foundation to refactor and document your software and policy so that they meet the Standard for Public Code
* enthusiasm for public code at the most senior levels within your organization
* a willingness to help the Foundation test its onboarding and code auditing processes, so we can get it right
* the ability to make in-kind contributions to help us develop our processes and governance, for example working with your legal department to confirm that our articles of association would be acceptable acceptable for your type of organization

## Founding membership: material support

This type of founding membership is open to public organizations that don’t currently have a codebase available, but are invested in creating a future for public code.

You should be willing to make:

* a significant financial commitment relative to your type and size of organization
* in-kind contributions of your staff to help us develop our processes so that they work better for your type of organization

You should also have enthusiasm for public code at the most senior levels within your organization.

## How to join the Foundation

If your organization is curious about either type of founding membership, then we’d love to hear from you. Please email us at <membership@publiccode.net>.
