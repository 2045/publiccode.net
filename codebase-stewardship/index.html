    <h1>Everything your project needs to be sustainable, collaborative and open.</h1>

    <p>
      Through <strong>codebase stewardship</strong> we help public-purpose open source codebases become successful by guaranteeing their quality and marketability. Trustworthy, usable, maintained and sustainable public code for your public organization.

  <div><h2>Making sure the code, tests and documentation are always up to the standards</h2>

  <p>
    We check every merge request on code, policy and documentation quality in our <strong>codebase auditing</strong> process. This enables agile development for trustworthy codebases for public organizations and their collaborators.

  <div><h2>Adding the stories and details a codebase needs to be noticed and re-used</h2>

  <p>
    Through <strong>product management</strong> we grow adoption and help mature the codebase to the point where it can shine on its own. So potential re-users and future contributors notice and adopt the codebase, we help turn it in to a product with strong branding and communications. We also support on development and design.

  <div><h2>Providing users, vendors and developers with the tools, skills and answers they need</h2>

  <p>
    To drive <strong>developer success</strong> we help with (end)user support, packaging, and distributing official versions as well as developing training materials and certifications. We also help vendors such as cooperatives, NGOs and for profit companies to sell, implement and support the product.

      We provide these services explicitly at <em>ecosystem level</em> – not at a national or city level – to make sure that context specific code or policy does not become a barrier to implementation.
      This means that we make sure that code is reusable across contexts globally.
    </p>
    <p>
      For local implementations we collaborate with local implementation partners, working actively with them to both integrate effectively in the local context while simultaneously making it easier for others to implement as well.
