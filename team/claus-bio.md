# Claus Mullie

As a coordinator, Claus both enables our team of stewards in delivering codebase stewardship, as well as supports our members with onboarding and policy.

Claus is fascinated by governance in large-scale complex systems, particularly at the intersection between government innovation, infrastructure, international relations and industrial policy.

Previously, Claus was project and community manager for the [SCORE community](https://score.community/), helping public sector organizations work together openly. He has also consulted governments on opening up and innovating their procurement processes, future proofing their infrastructure, and has worked at the European Commission's to develop policy and innovation agendas for public sector digitalisation at a European level.

Claus holds an MSc in Urbanisation and Development from the London School of Economics and Political Science and a BSc in Politics and International Relations from the University of Manchester.
