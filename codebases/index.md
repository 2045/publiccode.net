# Where we work: our codebases

The Foundation for Public Code helps to effectively scale codebases. We do this by supporting ambitious communities to build shared governance practices and smooth collaboration around their codebases.

Codebases are organized by [codebase maturity](https://about.publiccode.net/activities/codebase-stewardship/lifecycle.html).

## Assessment

In this phase, codebase communities and the Foundation for Public Code decide if:

* the codebase is a good fit for Foundation stewardship
* Foundation stewardship will meet the community's goals and ambitions

These codebases are currently in public assessment:

* [Signalen](https://github.com/Amsterdam/signals): receiving, automatically classifying and prioritising residentsâ€™ nuisance reports

## Incubation

Codebases in incubation are working to comply with the [Standard for Public Code](https://standard.publiccode.net/).

These codebases are currently in incubation:

* [OpenZaak](https://github.com/open-zaak/open-zaak): backend component to help municipalities manage and share data internally

## Mature

Mature codebases and communities fully meet the Standard for Public Code.

There are currently no mature codebases under Foundation stewardship.

## Attic

Codebases and communitities that were once Standard compliant but aren't any more are in the attic.

There are currently no codebases in our attic.
